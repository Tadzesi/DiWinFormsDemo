# WinForms Counter Application

This application demonstrates modern .NET development practices in a WinForms application, including dependency injection (DI), background processing, and asynchronous programming. The application shows a counter that increments every second, demonstrating different approaches to handling background operations.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a service-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Services**: Handle business logic and state management
- **UI Components**: Display data and handle user interactions
- **DI Container**: Manages object creation and lifetime

## Dependency Injection

### Why Use DI?

1. **Loose Coupling**
   - Services are defined by interfaces (ICounterService)
   - Components depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
   - Easy to swap implementations without changing consuming code

2. **Lifetime Management**
   ```csharp
   services.AddSingleton<ICounterService, CounterService>();
   services.AddSingleton<MainForm>();
   services.AddSingleton<CounterDisplay>();
   ```
   - Services can be registered as Singleton, Scoped, or Transient
   - DI container handles object creation and disposal
   - Consistent object lifetime across application

3. **Testability**
   - Services can be easily mocked for testing
   - Components can be tested in isolation
   - Dependencies are explicit and visible

### Implementation

```csharp
public class MainForm : Form
{
    private readonly ICounterService _counterService;
    
    public MainForm(ICounterService counterService)
    {
        _counterService = counterService;
        // ... 
    }
}
```

## Background Processing

The application demonstrates two approaches to background processing:

### BackgroundWorker Implementation

```csharp
public class CounterService : ICounterService
{
    private readonly BackgroundWorker _worker;
    
    public CounterService()
    {
        _worker = new BackgroundWorker();
        _worker.WorkerSupportsCancellation = true;
        _worker.DoWork += Worker_DoWork;
    }
    
    private async void Worker_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
    {
        while (!_worker.CancellationPending)
        {
            await Task.Delay(1000);
            // Update counter
        }
    }
}
```

#### Advantages:
- Built-in cancellation support
- Automatic thread marshaling
- Simple event-based model

#### Limitations:
- Limited async/await support
- Less control over threading
- Older programming model

### Async Task Implementation

```csharp
public class CounterService : ICounterService
{
    private CancellationTokenSource? _cts;
    private Task? _countingTask;
    
    public async Task StartCounting(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _cts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(cancellationToken);
        _countingTask = CountAsync(_cts.Token);
    }
    
    private async Task CountAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        while (!cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            await Task.Delay(1000, cancellationToken);
            // Update counter
        }
    }
}
```

#### Advantages:
- Full async/await support
- Better cancellation control
- Modern programming model
- More testable
- Better exception handling

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - .NET 6.0 or later
   - Visual Studio 2022 or later

2. **Required NuGet Packages**
   ```
   Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
   Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
   ```

3. **Running the Application**
   ```csharp
   static class Program
   {
       static void Main()
       {
           var host = CreateHostBuilder().Build();
           ServiceProvider = host.Services;
           Application.Run(ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<MainForm>());
       }
   }
   ```

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Service Pattern**
   - Clear separation between business logic and UI
   - Interface-based design
   - Single Responsibility Principle

2. **Resource Management**
   - Proper disposal of resources
   - Cancellation token usage
   - Clean shutdown handling

3. **Thread Safety**
   - Proper synchronization context usage
   - Safe UI updates
   - Cancellation handling

4. **Modern .NET Patterns**
   - Generic Host usage
   - Dependency injection
   - Async/await patterns
   - Strong typing
   - Interface segregation

5. **Error Handling**
   - Proper exception management
   - Graceful cancellation
   - UI thread safety

This application serves as a reference implementation for building modern WinForms applications using current .NET best practices. The concepts demonstrated here can be applied to larger applications to achieve better maintainability, testability, and scalability.
